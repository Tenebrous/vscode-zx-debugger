command> help set-debug-settings
Syntax: set-debug-settings|sds setting

Description
Set debug settings on remote command protocol. It's a numeric value with bitmask with different meaning:
Bit 0: show all cpu registers on cpu stepping or only pc+opcode.
Bit 1: show 8 next opcodes on cpu stepping.
Bit 2: Do not add a L preffix when searching source code labels.
Bit 3: Show bytes when debugging opcodes.
Bit 4: Repeat last command only by pressing enter.
Bit 5: Step over interrupt when running cpu-step, cpu-step-over and run verbose. It's the same setting as Step Over Interrupt on menu
